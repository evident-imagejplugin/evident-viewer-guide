## How to Install

1. Download the Evident Plugin installer, `OlympusViewer-mac2-4-1.run`.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the installer file is located:

   cd <the path to the installer files>
   ```

3. Assign execute permission to the installer:

   ```bash
   chmod a+x ./OlympusViewer-mac2-4-1.run
   ```

4. Run the installer:

   ```bash
   ./OlympusViewer-mac2-4-1.run
   ```

7. During the installation, the EULA will appear. Scroll using the ‘↓’ key, and type ‘y’ to agree and continue.
8. After installation, a new folder named **OlympusViewer-VerLatest** will be created.
9. Copy the **OlympusViewer-VerLatest** folder to the **plugins** folder of your ImageJ directory.
- If the **plugins** folder already contains an **OlympusViewer-VerLatest** folder, delete the existing folder before copying.
